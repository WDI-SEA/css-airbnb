#Airbnb Mockup

Lots of websites, including Facebook and Airbnb, use a grid layout to display common elements, such as information cards, photos, and other information. The best way to learn how to create these different layouts is to try them ourselves. So let's try recreating a portion of [Airbnb's website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

##Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository to your computer
* Run `npm install` in the folder to install dependencies
* A HTML file (`index.html`) and CSS file (`css/style.css`) have been created for you. Content is also provided in a folder called `img`
* List of handy scripts for this assignment
  - `npm start` - start the BrowserSync server
  - `npm run lint:css` - lint your CSS

##Requirements
* Look at the deliverable screenshot and see how well you can match it.
* Keep the following in mind when recreating the screenshot
  * Using the right font
  * Obtaining and using relevant images
  * Aligning the text in the center of each image
  * Aligning the images in the center of each page
  * Thinking of the layout in terms of rows and columns

##Deliverable

Here's a screenshot of the portion that should be replicated. Deliver the mockup as close as possible. In addition, code should be well-indented and follow best practices, including no linter errors.

##Bonus
Design agencies will usually have you own and create the whole page, not just a small portion of it. Try recreating the rest of the Airbnb home page!
